# Overview

This is a top-down space ship shooter! Blast your way through enemies for a higher score. The player can move around with WASD, and fire with the spacebar.

I made this game to get accustomed to using Unity, so this game is my first experience in the Unity engine.

Note that this repo only contains the scripts.
